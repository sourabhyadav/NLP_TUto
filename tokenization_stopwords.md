## Few NLP Terms

**Tokenizing?**
* Tokenizing is Grouping. When we group something with some constraints is called tokenizing.
* There are 2 basic types of tokenizer:
    * Word Tokenizer
    * Sentence Tokenizer

 **Corpora:**
 * Body of the given text e.g. presidential speeches, medical documents etc.

 **Lexicons:**
 * Words and their meanings.
 * Basically its not just english meaning but here meaning changes based on the context. Like "bull" is investment terms and also animal in different contexts.

**Stop Words:
* Words which people use sarcastically can be a stop-word, some words which you don't care about them.
* They are fillers in the sentence. Basically you wanna remove them.
* Sample stop words for english corpora are is, and, whom your etc.
* Actually these words make a lot of sense to us but for Data Science it becomes different to use
* Basically they even if you remove these words the meaning of sentence remains mostly same
